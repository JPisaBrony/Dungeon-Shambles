Cole Kainz's idea

a 3d game
a ball rolling through a maze
randomly generated maze that will always have at least one solution
maby traps and obstacles to overcome
generated graphics on the walls for fancy effects




Josh Philippy's idea

2d or 3d game

procedure generated dungeon crawl with instanced dungeons

an over world with access to all the dungeons or a dungeon listing system to select instanced dungeons

proficiency diagram - works by percentages increasing proficiency
decreases proficiency in opposing attribute

melee proficiency - percentage of the items potential is used 80% melee proficient makes the character use 80% of the item stats
magic proficiency - but with magic
enchanting proficiency - apply magic properties to items, usefulness of enchantment affected by magic

the percent value for crafting and enchanting is a multiple against the likely hood of successful creating the item/enchantment

killing enemies leave a deconstruct able corpse and possibly items they wearing

enchanting uses the essence of corpse - kill enemy -> deconstruct corpse -> use tool
                                                   \-> draw essence -> use enchanted item
                                                   
crafting & enchanting

% of over all skill is multiple
each skill has list of products - 2 ways to become proficient

1 brute force - a lot of material -> uses brute force method uses skill multiple
2 trainer - costs currency, slight increase in item specific proficiency, uses some amount of material as 1 item to produce
