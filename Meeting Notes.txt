Discussions 
	Switched to 2.5D game due to 3D complications
		(Note: to achieve 2.5D-ness - skewer the images. Can use Gimp)
	Customizable characters
	Still can use cursors for attacks by clicking on the area where player wishes to attack 
		Staying with WASD and hot keys for movement and casting
	Hallway's width: 3-5 multiple of main character
	Scrolling: the camera will follow the character. so character moves, camera moves
		Suggestion: similar to original zelda, walk out of screen, then camera follows
	There won't be gears for next dungeons, but character's stats builds up

Damages & Attributes
	Increase weapon stats when enemies' bodies are dismantled. Player choose attribute right then and there
	Reflector, modifier, and area damages.
	List of enchantments - refer to Josh
	Players have ability to 
		make new weapons or armors and give it random attributes
		make enchantments
		magical weapons contain 3 slots
		physical weapons contain 3 slots
		(For more information - ask Josh)
	Current task - determine what attributes enemies have

Game Evaluation

Attacks
	Shooting attacks by cursor aiming 
	Weapons will have physical attributes and magic enchantments
		will determine health status, hit, etc...
	Magic = no elements
		One type only: ranged or area of effect

Items
	Enchantments for items - same effects as attacks
		Magical Items can be orbs, gauntlet, or book
		Orbs can collect items
	Later levels: players can have use both magical and physical attacks
		Possibly a floating orb next to player
	Weapons are just base model - will be level it up with materials collected
	
Enemies
	Monsters - can be weak to magical or physical damage
	Enemies won't be dropping items 
	When enemies' corpse is dismantled 
		Attribute of items can be chosen by player
	Dismantling 
		Make enemies disappear
		Instances of the dungeon will handle that
			If dungeon gone - all corpse gone

Generating enemies
	Will have a number of enemies at certain points
	Will then generate upon ranged area
	Boss generated when player reach place
	Problem: viewing range of area when exiting
	Corpse should be simple
		Can turn into 2D image
		Can interact when mouse hover over image

Erick: Dungeon generating? Help JP
Plan
	Dungeon is generated upon entering (dynamic), then static afterwards
	There are limits to combinations for rooms and hallways
	Each hallway is fixed height and width
